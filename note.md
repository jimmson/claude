Make a research command similar to commands/reseach.md but make it specific to south african law.

It should closly follow reaserch.md but leave out the git stuff.

It should be able to do the following kind of research and more:


deep research on legal questions based on a set of facts,

Critical review of contracts as a whole, specific clauses, drafting and rewording of clauses for specific purposes,

Risk analysis and logical review of legal strategies

Technical Review and drafting legal pleadings in court,

For technical checks like cross referencing the effect of all the clauses in a contract against each other, checking for gaps in a contract which haven't been dealt with.
